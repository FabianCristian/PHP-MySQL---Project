# PHP-MySQL---Project

Here you'll find a project I made for college using PHP and SQL programming languages.
Download the files, import the database frizerie.sql into MySQL. Don't forget to copy frizerie folder into your WAMP server or any other server you use.
In Documentatie_DAW.docx you'll find the documentation where you can find the steps made in developing the application. (It's in Romanian so good luck :D )
In frizerie folder you can see the scripts, CSS files or auxiliary files needed.
Get in the application opening either about.php, appointment.php, programare.php or services.php. It really doesn't matter because you'll be redirected to the login page.
